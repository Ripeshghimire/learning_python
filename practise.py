# Question 1:
# Write a Python function to check if a given number is prime or not. 
#The function should return True if the number is prime and False otherwise.
# userInput = int(input("Enter a number"))
# count = 0
# for i in range(1,userInput+1):
#     if userInput % i == 0  :
#         count = count + 1
#     # else:
#     #     print("cannot but zero")
#     #     break

# if(count <= 2):
#     print(f'The given number is Prime {userInput}')
# elif(count >2):
#      print(f'The given number is composite {userInput}')


# Question 2:
# Write a Python function that takes a list of 
#integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list.
# num_list = []
# even_list = []
# for i in range(1,10):
#     userInput = int(input("Enter a number"))
#     num_list.append(userInput)
# print(num_list)
# for num in num_list:
#     if num % 2 == 0:
#         even_list.append(num)
# print(even_list)

# Question 3:
# Given a list of words, write a Python function that returns 
#the longest word from the list.
# words = ["Ripesh","GHimire","Dikshay","Linear","Regression"]
# greater =0
# for word in words:
#     length = len(word)
#     if(length > greater):
#         greater = length

# print(f'The greatest is {greater} ')
# Question 4:
# Write a Python class called Rectangle to represent a rectangle.
# The class should have attributes width and height, as well as methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
# class Rectangle:
#     def __init__(self) -> None:
#         pass
#     def area (l,b):
#         area = 1
#         userInput = int(input("Enter the lenght"))
#         userInput = int(input("ENter the breadth"))
#         area = l * b
#         print(area)
# Rectangle.area(1,2)
# Question 5:
# Write a Python program that takes a sentence as input and calculates the number of uppercase letters and lowercase letters in the sentence. The program should then print the counts.

# Question 6:
# Implement a Python function that takes a l
#List of numbers as input and returns the sum and average of the numbers.
# def SumandAverage():
#     soa = []
#     sum = 0
#     average = 0
#     for i in range(1,6):
#         userInput = int(input("Enter a number,"))
#         soa.append(i)
#     length = len(soa)
#     for num in soa:
#         sum = sum + num
#         average = sum / length
#     print(f'The sum is {sum}')
#     print(f'The average is {average}')

# SumandAverage()        
# Question 7:
# Write a Python program that reads a text file and 
# counts the number of occurrences of each word in the file. Print the word along with its count.

# Question 8:
# Create a Python function that takes a 
# list of strings as input and returns a new list containing the same strings but with the vowels removed.

# Question 9:
# Implement a Python function that takes a 
# list of integers as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order.


# Question 10:
# Write a Python program that generates the first n Fibonacci numbers and stores them in a list. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
